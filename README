==Calculating the EN pin resistor pair==
According to the tps54202h.pdf (SLVSDG7A – APRIL 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021)
there is a formula for calculating the resistor pair to be used for driving the EN pin:

Here is a matlab script for calculating the values:

v_en_rising=1.28
v_en_falling=1.25
rpd=1000000
ih=1/1000000
v_start=3.1
v_stop=v_start-0.48
r4=((v_en_falling/v_en_rising)*v_start-3)/ih
r5=r4*rpd/((v_start/v_en_rising-1)*rpd-r4)

You can also set r4=10000 ohm and find the coresponding r5 e.g. ~7K
